		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
        <p><b><i>Clarke</i></b>
            I was born and raised in North Carolina, and have yet to live anywhere else. I'd like to claim that I am
            trilingual, but my German is atrocious and my Vietnamese is at the level of an elementary school kid. Either way,
            that has to count for something, right? Outside of classes, I am either working on upgrading my PC or at work;
            some might say I am a workaholic that doesn't mind that I only make 11 an hour.
        </p>

        <p><b><i>Clarke</i></b>
            <em>I chose this course simply because it is required.</em> There's not really any expectations on my part; as
            the course is entirely online and asynchronous, I'd at least expect to take the initiative in learning. However, I
            do expect that course material is given in a timely manner.
