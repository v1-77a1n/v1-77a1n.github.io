                <h3><a href="https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/">Frans Hal Museum</a></h3>
            </section>
            <p class="desc">
                A website for the Frans Hal Museum that provides a little background on the exhibits available and a
                way to buy tickets.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: In terms of color contrast, the website's combination of colors made the elements on the
                website stand out. The different elements were used to section off important parts of the website; </li>
                <li>Repetition: There's not much repetition; the colors don't repeat at all. There's some repetition with
                shapes; squares are used throughout the entire website.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Every element on the website is aligned with each other, which helps a lot with the
                readability of the website.</li>
                <li>Proximity: In terms of proximity, all related elements are grouped together/near each other. They're
                all separated by color, which overall helps with user interaction.</li>
            </ul>
                <section>
                    <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
                </section>
                <p class="desc">
                    A website selling various electronics, vehicles, and bicycles; site is seemingly Scandinavian in
                    origin.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: In terms of contrast there's none whatsoever. The majority of the website is white
                    and the little black that is used doesn't help with differentiating elements and sections from
                    each other. There's also no spacing at all, which makes it an eyesore.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: There's no repeating patterns on the website at all. There are different shapes
                    everywhere on the page; some images have borders, others don't, etc.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: A majority of the website's elements aren't aligned with each other. They're all
                    pretty much all over the place; the items near each other aren't at the same alignment level.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Some elements that are similar are grouped together, but that can't be said
                    for everything that is similar on the website. </li>
                </ul>
